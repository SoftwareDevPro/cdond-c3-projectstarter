$ npm install
```

## Running the app

```bash
# development
$ npm run start

## Status/Healthcheck Endpoint

This API comes with a simple endpoint that provides it's status. If the API is not working, neither will the endpoint. This can be useful for load balancers and other applications that periodically check on the availability of a service.

`GET /status` => `{ status: "ok" }`

## Logging with Loggly

We are using Loggly with Winston to track log messages remotely. If you want to send your logs to Loggly, you should configure the following variables in your environment (either with `.env` or in your operating system):

```
LOGGLY_SUBDOMAIN=yoursubdomain
LOGGLY_TOKEN=yourlogglytoken
LOGGLY_LEVEL=info
```

You can obtain a free account from Loggly to test.

## Logging with Slack

You can also log things like errors to Slack to get faster notifications. If you want to send your logs to Slack, you should configure the following variables in your environment (either with `.env` or in your operating system):

```
SLACK_LOGGER_WEBHOOK=some webhook from slack
SLACK_LOGGER_CHANNEL=channelName
```

To further customize the log messages, you can also include these optional env vars:

```
SLACK_LOGGER_USERNAME=Sync Errors
SLACK_LOGGER_ICON_URL=http://someImage.com
SLACK_LOGGER_LOG_LEVEL=error
```

## Migrations

NOTE: Be sure you have your environment variables set up. See `DB Setup` section.

NestJS uses TypeORM to create, generate, run migrations.
To apply pending migrations you just need to run:

```bash
npm run migrations
```

If you have modified/created any entity you can generate a migration from it:

```bash
npm run migrations:generate -- --n <MigrationName>
```

To revert the last applied migration:

```bash
npm run migrations:revert
```

## DB Setup

You need to add some environment variables to your system in order to run migrations or the backend. For convenience, you can also create a `.env` file to represent your environment. Here's the format:

```
TYPEORM_CONNECTION=postgres
TYPEORM_HOST=localhost
TYPEORM_PORT=5432
TYPEORM_USERNAME=postgres
TYPEORM_PASSWORD=password
TYPEORM_DATABASE=glee2
TYPEORM_MIGRATIONS=./src/migrations/*.ts
TYPEORM_ENTITIES=./src/modules/**/*.entity.ts
```

## Migrations for CI/CD Review Apps

It would be best to spin up a database in RDS while we are spinning up a new environment in EB. BUT, it takes around 10 minutes to spin up a new DB in RDS. It's also more work to script the new db that we don't have time for. So, as a stop-gap, you can manually migrate a shared database ("dev") from the CI/CD screen in Gitlab. This will trigger a build step that runs "revert" and "run" to down and up the migrations. You must make sure that you have all the necessary db-related env vars in Gitlab so that this will work (see "DB Setup" section).

## Authentication with Auth0

Authentication has been applied to all endpoints, so it's not necessary to specify which endpoints require auth. For authentication to work, you will need some env vars, for example:

```
AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET= <id placeholder, check trello card on OIW board in resources lane>
AUTH0_CLIENT_ID= <id placeholder, check trello card on OIW board in resources lane>
AUTH0_DOMAIN=glee2-dev.auth0.com
AUTH0_AUDIENCE=http://localhost:3030
```

(These vars work for our `Acklen` tenant in Auth0 using the API called "testing".)

To test the API with Postman, you will need a valid JWT encrypted with RS256 and the correct client secret (amongst other things). You can generate said JWT by hitting Auth0's OAuth endpoint like this:

```
curl --request POST \
  --url https://acklen.auth0.com/oauth/token \
  --header 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data '{"client_id":"qrzt4jjhdmJHSdg5Ca6gVsdtY6x1xc2G","client_secret":"Xm6vhFnMv2BonJ8lhxsbCAZtIe5KjqqyXKNut5I5Spt4AQ3ms7mYTmwQ7JzIIwdt","audience":"http://localhost:3030","grant_type":"client_credentials"}'
```

(This only works with an "API" in Auth0. It will not work with an "Application" in Auth0 because they disable `client_credentials` grants by default and we have not found a way to enable that.)

To switch your backend to use the "Application" in Auth0, you should simply change the clientId, clientSecret, and audience in your environment variables.
